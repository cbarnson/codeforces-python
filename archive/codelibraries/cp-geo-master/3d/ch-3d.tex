\chapter{3D geometry}
In this chapter we cover the basic objects and concepts of 3D geometry, and the operations we can do on them. Although the additional dimension adds some complexity which can make things more difficult and interesting, a lot of things work the same way as they do in 2D. Therefore, we will make frequent references to chapter \ref{ch:basics}, which we consider as a prerequisite.
