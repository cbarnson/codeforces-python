Things to do
============

* Fix convex hull edge case (some small edge case that included at least three collinear lines would return the same point on both the upper and lower hull)
* Shortest Path Faster Algorithm
* Prim's algorithm
* More formulas for geometry, trigonometry, —Åombinatorics, number theory
* Hungarian algorithm
* Sweeping line algorithm for finding the pair of intersecting segments in a set of segments
* Add more Geometry stuff.
* Add a list of debugging tips
* Add a list of algorithm types to keep in mind when solving a problem
* Add more formulas
* Test Tridiagonal matrix algorithm on http://codeforces.com/contest/24/problem/D
* Use the Node interface of Segment Tree in HLD.
* Primitive root finder should only check prime divisors
* Clean up undirected Euler path (and don't assume cycle)
* Refactor matrix code (what about inverse?)
* http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/47758
* Simplify KMP


* Implement our own Simplex method? Or simplify the current code?
* Implement our own Dynamic convex hull trick?

How do we check how much memory is used by an executable?
