# Disclaimer!

With the exception of `UofL-codeLibrary` (team codebook during my time at the University of Lethbridge), the folders you see here are NOT mine, but rather collected by me over time for my own personal learning and reference.  Most were cloned right from GitHub, and the folder names reflect that.  I encourage you to seek out the original repositories and their authors' other work.
